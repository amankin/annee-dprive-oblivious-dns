             Oblivious DNS - Strong Privacy for DNS Queries
                  draft-annee-dprive-oblivious-dns-00

Abstract

   Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries,
   a number of standards have been developed and services deployed that
   that encrypt a user's DNS queries to the recursive resolver and thus
   obscure them from some network observers and from the user's Internet
   service provider.  However, these systems merely transfer trust to a
   third party.  We posit that argue that no single party should be able
   to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those
   queries.  To this end, this document specifies Oblivious DNS (ODNS),
   which introduces an additional layer of obfuscation between clients
   and their queries.  To accomplish this, ODNS uses its own
   authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the ODNS
   namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they
   receive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that
   initiated these queries.  The ODNS experimental protocol is
   compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Privacy terminology is as described in Section 3 of [RFC6973].

   DNS terminology is as described in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis]
   with one modification: we use the definition of Privacy-enabling DNS
   server taken from [RFC8310]:

7.  IANA considerations

   For initial experimental deployment of this protocol, the name
   obliviousdns.com has been registered.  Its length is a drawback, for
   the reasons discussed in Section 5.3 and a shorter privately
   registered name may be chosen for future larger-scale
   experimentation.  An infrastructure related zone would be more
   advantageous choice.  Therefore discussion should resolve the
   appropriateness and conditions of a request for a special use domain
   name, e.g. odns.arpa.  This falls under the considerations in
   [RFC3172].  Notes: because of restrictions on TLD registration,
   following the example of .onion [RFC7686] is infeasible.  Traffic for
   ODNS traverses normal Internet paths, therefore the IANA special use
   registry recently established for Locally-Served DNS Zones, in which
   home.arpa has recently been registered [RFC8375], is also not a model
   for IANA considerations for the ODNS Namespace.

8.  Security considerations

   TODO (some questions to consider): what are residual risks in the
   ODNS scheme and additional mitigations?  Is there any increase in
   attack surface for the users and operators in ODNS?  Are systems
   depending on ODNS vulnerable to DoS in specific ways that should be
   mitigated?

9.  Acknowledgements

   TODO: Acknowledge funding source here if desired.
